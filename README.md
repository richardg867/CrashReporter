CrashReporter
=============

You know how frustrating it is to have your modded Minecraft server crash, and there's nobody to solve it, and no clue as to what caused the crash. CrashReporter was created to get around that.

**How to install:** Put jar in mods folder, start server once, edit config/crashreporter.cfg - please note CrashReporter will not work on clients due to a sidedness limitation.

**How to build:** Point FORGE_PATH on build.py to a Forge source install and run the script. Requires Python 2 and command-line 7z (for Windows, take 7z.exe out of 7-Zip's folder)

CrashReporter was originally part of my constantly-reborn ServerMod project, but since it was the only useful part of it, I decided to separate it.
